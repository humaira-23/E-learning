            <div class="topic-exp">
                <p>What is Isomerism?</p>
                <p>It is a phenomenon where two or more compounds have the same chemical formula but possesses different structural formulas and different properties. This is mainly because of different structural or spatial arrangements. Isomers are the compounds exhibiting this phenomenon.</p>
                <p>Types of Isomerism: <br> Basically, there are two types. They are:</p>
                <p>•	Structural Isomerism</p>
                <p>•	Stereoisomerism</p>
                <p>However, these are again of many subtypes:</p>
                <p>•	Structural Isomerism <br>
                Isomers are structural isomers when they have the same molecular formula but different structures. Structural isomerism is further of the following types. Let's learn about these types, one-by-one.</p>
                <p>1.	Chain Isomerism: <br>
                Isomers are chain isomers when two or more compounds have the same molecular formula but differ in the branching of carbon atoms. For example, we can represent C5H12 as three compounds: CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3- pentane</p>
                <p>2.	Position Isomerism: <br>
                Isomers are position isomers when the two or more compounds differ in the position of the functional group or substituent atoms. For example, we can represent C3H7OH in two arrangements:</p>
                    CH3CH2CH2OH                    -Propan-1-ol</p>
                <p>3.	Functional Isomerism: <br>
                Isomers are functional isomers when the two or more compounds have an identical molecular formula but differ in the functional group present. For example, we can represent C3H6O as a ketone and as an aldehyde.</p>
                <p>4.	Metamerism: <br>
                This is exhibited by compounds due to the presence of different alkyl chains on either side of the functional group. For example, we can represent C4H10O as ethoxyethane (C2H5OC2H5) and methoxy propane (CH3OC3H7)</p>
            
                <p>•	Stereoisomerism <br>
                Stereoisomerism is a phenomenon in which compounds have the same molecular formula but differ in the relative positioning or orientation of atoms in space. Stereoisomers are the compounds exhibiting stereoisomerism. We can further classify stereoisomerism into:</p>
                <p>1.	Geometric Isomerism: <br>
                It is shown by molecules in which their spatial positions are locked to each other due to the presence of a ring structure or a double bond.</p>
                <p>2.	Optical Isomerism: <br>
                Two or more compounds that have the same molecular arrangement but differ in the optical activity are optical isomers.</p>

            <div class="topic-name">Work</div>
            <div class="topic-exp">
                <p>	Work, in physics, measure of energy transfer that occurs when an object is moved over a distance by an external force at least part of which is applied in the direction of the displacement. If the force is constant, work may be computed by multiplying the length of the path by the component of the force acting along the path. To express this concept mathematically, the work W is equal to the force f times the distance d, or W = fd. If the force is being exerted at an angle θ to the displacement, the work done is W = fd cos θ. Work done on a body is accomplished not only by a displacement of the body as a whole from one place to another but also, for example, by compressing a gas, by rotating a shaft, and even by causing invisible motions of the particles within a body by an external magnetic force.</p>
                <p>No work, as understood in this context, is done unless the object is displaced in some way and there is a component of the force along the path over which the object is moved. Holding a heavy object stationary does not transfer energy to it, because there is no displacement. Holding the end of a rope on which a heavy object is being swung around at constant speed in a circle does not transfer energy to the object, because the force is toward the centre of the circle at a right angle to the displacement. No work is done in either case. </p>
                <p>The mathematical expression for work depends upon the particular circumstances. Work done in compressing a gas at constant temperature may be expressed as the product of pressure P times the change in volume dV; that is, W = PdV. Work done by a torque T in rotating a shaft through an angle φ may be expressed as the product of the torque times the angular displacement; that is, W = Tφ.</p>
                <p>Work done on a body is equal to the increase in the energy of the body, for work transfers energy to the body. If, however, the applied force is opposite to the motion of the object, the work is considered to be negative, implying that energy is taken from the object. The units in which work is expressed are the same as those for energy, for example, in SI (International System of Units) and the metre-kilogram-second system, joule (newton-metre); in the centimetre-gram-second system, erg (dyne-centimetre); and in the English system, foot-pound.</p>

            <div class="topic-name">Adsorption</div>
            <div class="topic-exp">
                <p>Adsorption, capability of all solid substances to attract to their surfaces molecules of gases or solutions with which they are in contact. Solids that are used to adsorb gases or dissolved substances are called adsorbents; the adsorbed molecules are usually referred to collectively as the adsorbate. An example of an excellent adsorbent is the charcoal used in gas masks to remove poisons or impurities from a stream of air.</p>
                <p>Adsorption refers to the collecting of molecules by the external surface or internal surface (walls of capillaries or crevices) of solids or by the surface of liquids. Absorption, with which it is often confused, refers to processes in which a substance penetrates into the actual interior of crystals, of blocks of amorphous solids, or of liquids. Sometimes the word sorption is used to indicate the process of the taking up of a gas or liquid by a solid without specifying whether the process is adsorption or absorption.</p>
                <p>Adsorption can be either physical or chemical in nature. Physical adsorption resembles the condensation of gases to liquids and depends on the physical, or van der Waals, force of attraction between the solid adsorbent and the adsorbate molecules. There is no chemical specificity in physical adsorption, any gas tending to be adsorbed on any solid if the temperature is sufficiently low or the pressure of the gas sufficiently high. In chemical adsorption, gases are held to a solid surface by chemical forces that are specific for each surface and each gas. Chemical adsorption occurs usually at higher temperatures than those at which physical adsorption occurs; furthermore, chemical adsorption is ordinarily a slower process than physical adsorption and, like most chemical reactions, frequently involves an energy of activation.</p>

            <div class="topic-name">Force</div>
            <div class="topic-exp">
                <p>Force, in mechanics, any action that tends to maintain or alter the motion of a body or to distort it. The concept of force is commonly explained in terms of Isaac Newton's three laws of motion set forth in his Principia Mathematica (1687). According to Newton's first principle, a body that is at rest or moving at a uniform rate in a straight line will remain in that state until some force is applied to it. The second law says that when an external force acts on a body, it produces an acceleration (change in velocity) of the body in the direction of the force. The magnitude of the acceleration is directly proportional to the magnitude of the external force and inversely proportional to the quantity of matter in the body. Newton's third law states that when one body exerts a force on another body, the second body exerts an equal force on the first body. This principle of action and reaction explains why a force tends to deform a body (i.e., change its shape) whether or not it causes the body to move. The deformation of a body can usually be neglected when investigating its motion.</p>
                <p>Because force has both magnitude and direction, it is a vector quantity. The representation of forces by vectors implies that they are concentrated either at a single point or along a single line. This is, however, physically impossible. On a loaded component of a structure, for example, the applied force produces an internal force, or stress, that is distributed over the cross section of the component. The force of gravity is invariably distributed throughout the volume of a body. Nonetheless, when the equilibrium of a body is the primary consideration, it is generally valid as well as convenient to assume that the forces are concentrated at a single point. In the case of gravitational force, the total weight of a body may be assumed to be concentrated at its centre of gravity (see gravity, centre of).</p>
                <p>Physicists use the newton, a unit of the International System (SI), for measuring force. A newton is the force needed to accelerate a body weighing one kilogram by one metre per second per second. The formula F = ma is employed to calculate the number of newtons required to increase or decrease the velocity of a given body. In countries still using the English system of measurement, engineers commonly measure force in pounds. One pound of force imparts to a one-pound object an acceleration of 32.17 feet per second squared.</p>

            <div class="topic-name">Colloids</div>
            <div class="topic-exp">
                <p>Colloids (also known as colloidal solutions or colloidal systems) are mixtures in which microscopically dispersed insoluble particles of one substance are suspended in another substance. The size of the suspended particles in a colloid can range from 1 to 1000 nanometres (10-9 metres). For a mixture to be classified as a colloid, its suspended particles must not settle (in the manner that the particles of suspensions settle at the bottom of the container if left undisturbed). Colloidal solutions are known to exhibit the Tyndall Effect, which is a phenomenon in which beams of light incident on colloids are scattered due to the interactions between the light and the colloidal particles.</p>
                <p>The IUPAC definition of the colloidal state can be written as follows: “The colloidal state is the state of subdivision in which molecules or polymolecular particles having at least one dimension in the range of 1 nanometre and 1 micrometre, are dispersed in some medium“. Colloids usually feature substances that are evenly dispersed in another. In such mixtures, the substance that is dispersed is referred to as the dispersed phase whereas the substance through which it is dispersed is called the continuous phase.</p>
                <p>Application of Colloids: <br> Colloids are widely useful in industries, medical and domestic applications.</p>
                <p>1) As food items: <br>
                    Syrup, Halwa, Soup belongs to a colloidal type of system.</p>
                <p>2) Medicine: <br>
                    Colloidal silver in the name of Argyrols, it acts as antiseptic for eye infection.</p>
                <p>3) In Purification of air by Cottrell precipitator: <br>
                    This process involves coagulation of solution particle. Dust or smoke is passed through the inlet of an electrified chamber which has a central electrical plate which is provided with opposite charge of a dent a smoke particle when dust passes the particles are coagulated and pure air is passed through another outlet.</p>
                <p>4) Tanning of leather: <br>
                    Animal skins are very soft, when these are immersed in the solution of tannin which has the opposite charge of animal skin, particles are coagulated and the skin becomes hard this is known as tanning of leather.</p>
                <p>5) Formation of delta: <br>
                    It involves coagulation of clay particles of the river with an electrolyte of seawater.</p>

            <div class="topic-exp">
                <p>Velocity, quantity that designates how fast and in what direction a point is moving. A point always moves in a direction that is tangent to its path; for a circular path, for example, its direction at any instant is perpendicular to a line from the point to the centre of the circle (a radius). The magnitude of the velocity (i.e., the speed) is the time rate at which the point is moving along its path.</p>
                <p>If a point moves a certain distance along its path in a given time interval, its average speed during the interval is equal to the distance moved divided by the time taken. A train that travels 100 km in 2 hours, for example, has an average speed of 50 km per hour.</p>
                <p>During the two-hour interval, the speed of the train in the previous example may have varied considerably around the average. The speed of a point at any instant may be approximated by finding the average speed for a short time interval including the instant in question. The differential calculus, which was invented by Isaac Newton for this specific purpose, provides means for determining exact values of the instantaneous velocity.</p>
                <p>Because it has direction as well as magnitude, velocity is known as a vector quantity and cannot be specified completely by a number, as can be done with time or length, which are scalar quantities. Like all vectors, velocity is represented graphically by a directed line segment (arrow) the length of which is proportional to its magnitude.</p>
